<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>
</ul><h4><p>Online learning has become extremely prevalent in these past few years especially due to Covid-19. World wide institutions are adopting more flexible, convenient and accessible education methods to increase and potentially widen the learning community. Online learning is not only more educationally effective due to better retention of information, faster learning times, and increased productivity. It also cuts cost by up to an increase of 70% in savings (Why Online Learning Is More Efficient and Cost-Effective than Alternatives, 2020),  this is due to cutting edge technology that allows the ability to share online courses without the aid of external parties. This means we can cut off teacher salaries, transportation costs, course material costs and more (Why Online Learning Is More Efficient and Cost-Effective than Alternatives, 2020).<p></h4>
