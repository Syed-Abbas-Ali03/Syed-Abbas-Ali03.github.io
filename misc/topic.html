<h1>Why We Chose This Topic</h1>




<p><em>Online learning has grown in popularity, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

There is a growing interest in understanding the effectiveness of online learning compared  to traditional classroom-based learning, and in identifying strategies to improve the quality of online education.</p></em>
