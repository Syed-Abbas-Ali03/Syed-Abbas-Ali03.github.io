<h1>Choices for Risk mitigation</h1>


</ul><h4><p>To mitigate these risks it is important to implement anti-cheat measures
in the online learning environment, one solution is creating a rule where
students faces must be visible and their screen must be streamed to the
teacher. Providing technical support for students who are having trouble
connecting. Having icebreakers/ fun group activity so students get the
chance to interact with each other.<p></h4>
